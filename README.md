# Exercise-5

This week we will practice how to create static and interactive maps in Python.  

- Exercise 5 is due by the start of lecture on 4.12.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L5/exercise-5-hints.html) if you're having trouble.

- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.

## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of the AutoGIS course, we would again ask you to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/84893/lomake.html) to help us
to continue developing and improving the course.

## Instructions for storing the maps

For this exercise a folder called `docs` have been created the Exercise 5 repository. You should upload **ALL** your maps under that folder and add links 
to those maps in the specific Entrance page (index.md) that is also located under that folder. There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md). 

## Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it (8 points)

Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lesson and **create as interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map(s) that you can**.
You can read a few useful hints about [what to consider when creating maps from this post](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/).

Upload your maps to the `docs` folder and create link to those map(s) in the `index.md` file. **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations on the current datasets 
or use also the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, thus the subject what you are presenting is not important.  

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (12 points)

Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lesson and **create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map(s) 
that you can** using either Bokeh or Folium or both. You can read a few useful hints about [what to consider when creating maps from this post](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/).

Upload your maps to the `docs` folder and create link to those map(s) in the `index.md` file. **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations on the current datasets 
or use also the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, thus the subject what you are presenting is not important.  

## Grading (by AK 10.12.)
### Problem 1 (7,75/8 points)
Great looking map and a neat idea! Classes or their presentation could use some refinement.

### Problem 2 (12/12 points)
Really great map! And good job with the legend

**Total: 20/20 points**
